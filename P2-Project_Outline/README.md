# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Our plan is to design a site where a person can not only search movies to see what streaming service they can watch them on, but can also create an account to save movies they wish to watch to their profile. Our first release will include a user authentication feature where one can create an account and save movies to their account in a list, or lists. These items will also be deletable. The lists will also be sortable. Accounts will be manageable as well, allowing for usernames and passwords to change, and maybe even profile pictures.

The first release will include a simple search engine using text and filtering with a few categories. The first release search-by categories will include streaming service, genre, rating, and year released. The first release can likely show results in alphabetical order (ascending and descending), and we will likely show those results over multiple pages, instead of all at once.

The application will be mobile responsive.

### Features
• User Login with safe authentication, passwords using encryption and SALT
• Search feature - Users can search by text, as well as by streaming service, genre, rating and year released.
• User lists - Users can create a list of movies they like and sort those lists for better viewing. Items on lists can be removed
• Code that allows the app to be mobile responsive.
• User profiles that can be edited/managed by that user.

### Technologies
We plan to implement the React framework and use JavaScript to write all the front-end and back-end tech. We will feed data into a MySQL database, and plan to use Postman to test our APIs. We may augment this system with C# on the back-end.

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will need to learn React, use Postman to learn more about APIs, and may even be learning to use C# on the back end instead of JS (which is an idea I'm partial to). Doing JS on front end and C# on back end is a new concept for us.
