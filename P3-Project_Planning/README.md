## Submission Instructions

### Wireframes

All of the current wireframes are at <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVP4STnGU=/">this address</a>

One major change that will show up is a bootstrap/equivalent floating header on most pages. Likely that about page (which I added to comply with TMDB's usage policy) will be deleted in favor of Jordan's design putting the legal info at the bottom of pages that use the search engine.
